### Stimulus
- Looking to get as many rounds and reps as possible in this 15 minutes workout
- Pick a reo scheme for pull-ups that allows you to maintain a steady pace for the whole 15 minutes
- Example Pull-Up rep schemes
5-4
4-3-2
3-3-3
3-2-2-2

### Singles
- On the pushups we are looking for a full lock out of the arms at the top of the movement and hands off the ground at the bottom
- As we move through push-ups our body should go from the top to the bottom in a straight line through the movement
- If unable to complete 15 Hand release push-ups you can substitute knee push-ups
- Always preferring planned breaks over forced breaks. Keep this in mind when heading into this workout
